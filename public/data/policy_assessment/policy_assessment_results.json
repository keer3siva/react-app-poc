Since 2018 the UK regulatory authorities have initiated a shift in our thinking in the following ways: Focus attention on the services in which operational disruption could have the biggest impact on customers, the UK financial system or on the bank itself. The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), together the regulators, have definitions for what constitutes 'important business services' for operational resilience and 'critical services' for OCiR. The relative importance of activities under Business Continuity Management and Business Incident Management are set by TSB. The risks being addressed by the policy relate to: Disruption to core business activities leading to impact to services for customers, potential customer harm and financial loss; Inability to operate critical economic functions (CEF) or core business lines (CBL) effectively in a resolution scenario; and Inability to remain within impact tolerances in the event of a severe-but-plausible scenario leading to intolerable customer harm, a risk to the safety and soundness of TSB and increased regulatory scrutiny. Managing these risks appropriately will provide TSB with comfort that; We know which services (or activities) can have the biggest impact on TSB, or the point at which disruption becomes intolerable; We understand how they are delivered, and therefore the impact on a service when component parts are disrupted (e.g. an IT application or third party supplier); We test our ability to respond and recover to severe but plausible scenarios, which builds confidence in being able to weather the storm; and We are able to evidence our approach to give confidence to TSB Board members, regulators, shareholders and our customers that we can continue to deliver what is important / critical to them.",

                "Reason": "The provided policy document does not explicitly address non-discrimination against consumers legally resident in the EU based on their nationality or place of residence when applying for or accessing a payment account. The policy focuses on customer communications, financial promotions, and compliance with various regulatory requirements but does not mention specific measures to prevent discrimination based on nationality or place of residence.",
                "Excerpt_Evidence_From_Policy": "The policy document does not contain any specific sections or statements that address the requirement to not discriminate against consumers legally resident in the EU based on their nationality or place of residence.",
                "Remediation_Recommendation": "To achieve full compliance, TSB should include a clear and explicit statement in the policy document that outlines the commitment to non-discrimination against consumers legally resident in the EU based on their nationality or place of residence. This should include specific procedures and measures to ensure that all applications for payment accounts are processed without any bias related to nationality or place of residence. Additionally, TSB should implement training programs for staff to ensure adherence to this non-discrimination policy and regularly audit account application processes to verify compliance."

The document primarily discusses governance standards, customer communications, financial promotions, and compliance with various regulatory requirements related to communications.",
                "Remediation_Recommendation": "To achieve full compliance, TSB should update the policy document to explicitly include provisions for offering a payment account with basic features to eligible consumers. The policy should also clearly state that no fees will be charged for the services set out in regulation 19(1) when those services are provided as part of a payment account with basic features. Additionally, TSB should ensure that these provisions are communicated to all relevant staff and included in training programs to ensure adherence."
