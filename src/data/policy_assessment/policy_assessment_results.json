              "Excerpt_Evidence_From_Policy": "The policy document does not contain any specific sections or text that address the requirements of the switching service, including roles, time limits, fees, and consumer rights.",
              "Remediation_Recommendation": "To achieve full compliance, TSB should include a dedicated section in the policy document that explicitly outlines the provision of information about the switching service. This section should cover: (a) the roles of the transferring and receiving payment service providers; (b) the time limits for the completion of tasks; (c) any fees that are to be charged; (d) details of any information that the consumer is required to provide; (e) details of the consumer\u2019s right to make a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Additionally, TSB should ensure that this information is made available free of charge on paper or another durable medium at all premises accessible to consumers and in electronic form on the payment service provider\u2019s website at all times."
